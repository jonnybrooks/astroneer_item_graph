## Greetings fellow Astroneer!

http://astroneer.panthalassa.digital

As a game I've sunken almost 100 hours into now, it should go without saying that I am totally in love with Astroneer. In all these hours of playing though I've noticed when aiming to build some particular thingy I spend a bunch of time trying to optimise my resource gathering in an effort to make it as fast as possible.

For example let's say we want to focus on spacefaring as quickly as we can. What does that entail? Let's see:
- At a mininum that means we need a Small Shuttle, plus a Solid-Fuel Thruster and seat
- Researching and building a Vehicle Bay = Bytes and Compound
- Researching and building a Small Shuttle = Bytes and Aluminum
- But Aluminum also requires Laterite and a Smelting Furnace
- A Smelting Furnace requires Bytes, Compound and a platform to build it on
- etc. etc...
...and as you can see this can become quite complex - especially for late-game items! (The list for NanoCarbon Alloy for example is insane). For me this would usually involve opening a bunch of Astroneer gamepedia windows (I can't be the only one) and juggling around all the values in my head.

So in an attempt to make my life a little easier, I built a tool that - given some item name - spits out a list of all the resources you need to build a certain thingy, and draws some cute little interactive graphs showing which items depend on which other items. They look a little like constellations which I thought was pretty neat! Here's some screenshots:

It's at a *super* early, barebones stage at the moment but I think it already provides some good value to the community, so I thought I'd share it and get as much feedback as I can! You can play with it at: http://astroneer.panthalassa.digital. Please feel free to tell me what you'd like added by [submitting an issue on the application's code repository](https://github.com/jonnybrooks/astroneer_item_graph/issues/new). If you're a developer please don't hesitate to submit a pull request for features yourself!

But anyway I really hope you guys like it and that it helps you on your journey through the stars. See you space cowboys!
